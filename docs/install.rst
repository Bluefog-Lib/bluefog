Installing Bluefog
==================

Bluefog currently supports MacOS and Linux only. 


Installing Bluefog from Pip (CPU)
---------------------------------
Installing from pip should be sufficient for most Bluefog users.
However, our implementation highly independent on the MPI and other libraries. Please
make sure that ``python>=3.7`` and
``gcc>=4.0`` and supporting ``std=C++11`` in your development environment. 
We recommend using `conda`_ as python environment control. 
Most dependent python package should be automatically installed through the pip.
Lastly, we relied on the MPI implementation, please install 
`open-mpi>=4.0` `download link`_ and `instruction`_ for CPU usage.
After you think the environment is all set, just run following command to install Bluefog:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir bluefog

.. Note::

    We haven't fully tested our compatiblity with hisotrical torch versions.
    It is guaranteed at least for ``torch==1.4.0`` and ``torchvision==0.5.0`` case.
    Remember if the torch version is changed, you have to re-install bluefog completely.

.. Note::

    If ``--no-cache-dir`` is not present, you may receive the error information like
    ``Failed building wheel for bluefog``, which won't fail the installation though.
    The reason is Bluefog is a library with C-extention,
    which needs to be built on your system. Check this `stack overflow`_ answer if you are interested.


Installing Bluefog from Pip (GPU)
---------------------------------
All steps for GPU case are the same as CPU case except for the OpenMPI installation.
In order to get full support of GPU, you have to install `CUDA>=10.1` 
and install pytorch with the GPU support version. 
It is highly recommended to use NCCL instead of OpenMPI as GPU
communication implementation. We require the ``NCCL>=2.7`` since our implementation heavily
relied on the new `ncclSend` and `ncclRecv` API introduced after version 2.7.
To install Bluefog with NCCL implementation, you need to run

.. code-block:: bash

    BLUEFOG_WITH_NCCL=1 pip install --no-cache-dir bluefog

You can also install the GPU-aware OpenMPI as GPU communication implementation.
To do that, you can configure the open install setting
after the download of OpenMPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./configure --prefix={YOUR_OWN_PREFIX} --with-cuda && \
    make -j $(nproc) all && \
    make install


Installing Bluefog from Github Directly
---------------------------------------

.. important:: 

    The lastest functionality may not be able avaiable through ``pip install bluefog``.
    Installing from Github is better during our early development stage.

First, please check your environment as mentioned in above subsections. Then,
clone or download the bluefog repository from `Github`_. Last, just run the
following command under the root folder of bluefog repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

Use Bluefog through Docker
--------------------------
The docker image for Bluefog can be accessed through `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/bluefoglib/bluefog>`_.
For more details, check :ref:`Docker Usage` page.

1. Download docker image with CUDA support:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker pull bluefoglib/bluefog:gpu-0.3.0

2. Download docker image with only CPU support:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker pull bluefoglib/bluefog:cpu-0.3.0
