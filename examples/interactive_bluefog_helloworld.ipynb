    "# Run BlueFog with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal** of this ipython notebook is to show you how you can run BlueFog code in ipython notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, the BlueFog framework is aimed to run decentralized algorithm over a cluster of processes or machines.\n",
    "Meanwhile, jupyter notebook is an execellent interactive frontend talking with single IPython process. The contradiction between a single frontend process and a cluster of backend processescan be completely circumvented, fortunately. The main idea is using the jupyter notebook as the driver to inform how the cluster will execute the BlueFog code. On one hand, the execution of BlueFog still runs over multiple processes so that you can enjoy the scalability and parallelism brought by BlueFog. On the other hand, you (the programmer) can interactively execute with BlueFog and monitor and control the code in the single place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites: \n",
    "To begin with, make sure that you have installed OpenMPI and BlueFog in your system first.\n",
    "Besides these, you also need to install [ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package for managering the parallel computation.\n",
    "Usually, you can install it through `pip install jupyter ipyparallel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to start Bluefog with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Start jupyter notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2A: Start the `ibfrun` (interactive bluefog run) in a single machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "ibfrun start -np 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `np` means the number of process. In this example command, it will start 4 processes. You are free to choose any number between 1 and the number of CPU processes in you machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2B: Start the `ibfrun` in multiple machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "ibfrun start -np 16 -H machine-a:4,machine-b:4,machine-c:4,machine-d:4\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `machine-a` to `machine-d` are the machine name or the address of the machine and `:4` after the machine name means on that machine launch 4 processes. Before you run this command, please make sure that all the machines is able to be login through `ssh` **without** typing the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other remarks**\n",
    "- Please make sure the jupyter notebook command and the ibfrun command are under the same machine.\n",
    "- If you want to communicate over GPUs through NCCL, the number of process in each machine should not exceed the number GPUs instead of CPUs.\n",

The controller knows how to communicate with the IPython client and the workers. When you execute the code under `px` environment, the following procedure happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The notebook sends the user code back to the IPython client.\n",
    "2. The IPython client notices this code is needed to be run under `px` so it forwards the code to the controller.\n",
    "3. The controller forwards the code to the worker according to `--targets`. By default, it forwards to all workers.\n",
    "4. The workers accept the command and execute it in parallel. If there is data exchange among the processes, the communication will be performed through the MPI or NCCL.\n",
    "5. After all workers finish executing the code, the jupyter notebook will be notified that the execution is done.\n",

    "\n",
    "As for the `push` and `pull` commands in direct view, their execution procedures are similar as the `px` data flow.\n",

If you have some speical requirement or you have problem of executing `ibfrun`, you can use the `ipcontroller` or `ipengin` command directly. Check [ipyparallel document](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process.html) for more details."
